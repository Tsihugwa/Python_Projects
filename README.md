Strong Password Generator
This is a simple password generator that creates strong, secure passwords of a specified length. The password can include special characters and numbers if desired. The generated password can also be easily copied to the clipboard.

Getting Started
To use the password generator, run the script and enter the desired password length, and select whether or not to include special characters and numbers. Then click the "Generate" button to create a new password. The password can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.

Requirements
This script requires Python 3 and the tkinter library.

Code
The code for generating the password is located in the generate_password function. The password is created by adding a random selection of characters from the string string.ascii_letters + string.digits, with the option to include special characters from the string.punctuation string. The generated password is then shuffled to increase unpredictability.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is created using tkinter. The input fields and buttons are created using tkinter widgets, and the resulting password is displayed in a label widget. The "Copy" button is bound to the copy_password function which uses the tkinter.clipboard.copy function to copy the password to the clipboard.

Usage
To use the password generator, run the script and enter the desired password length in the "Length" field. Select the "Include special characters" and "Include numbers" checkboxes if desired, and then click the "Generate" button to create a new password. The password will be displayed in the "Password" field, and can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.
