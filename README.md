Welcome to the Hangman game on GitHub!

This code allows you to play a classic game of Hangman, in which you try to guess a randomly chosen word by guessing one letter at a time. The code includes the following functions:

choose_word: This function reads in a list of words from a text file and returns a random word from the list.
create_word_string: This function takes in the chosen word and a list of letters that have been guessed, and returns a string with the correctly guessed letters and underscores for the unguessed letters.
get_guess: This function prompts the user to input a single letter and checks that the input is valid (a single letter that has not been guessed before).
play_hangman: This function runs the main game loop, including calling the other functions to choose a word, get guesses from the user, and display the progress of the game. The game ends when the word is correctly guessed or the user runs out of guesses.
To run the game, simply clone or download the code and run the play_hangman function. Happy guessing!
