This is a simple Hangman Game using Python
This code has the following features:

choose_word: Chooses a random word from a list of words in the file words.txt.
create_word_string: Creates a string with the letters in the secret word that have been guessed and underscores for the letters that have not been guessed yet.
get_guess: Prompts the user for a letter and checks that it is a valid guess (i.e., a single letter that has not been guessed yet).
play_hangman: The main function that runs the game. It chooses a word, prompts the user to guess letters, and displays the word with underscores for unknown letters. The game ends when either the word is guessed or the number of incorrect guesses reaches 6.
