Email Slicer

A simple python script that slices an email address to extract the username and domain. The script also uses a regular expression to validate the email address and sends a personalized message to the user.

Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine

Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script using python email_slicer.py

When prompted, enter your email address

If the email address is valid, you will see your username, domain, and a personalized message printed to the terminal

You will also receive an email with the same information

Requirements

Python 3.6 or above

The os and re libraries

Note

The sendmail command in the script is currently set up to work with Unix-based systems. If you are running this script on a Windows machine, you will need to modify the os.system line to use a different command for sending emails.
