Magic 8 Ball
This is a simple Python program that simulates the classic Magic 8 Ball game. It allows the user to ask a yes or no question, and provides a randomly chosen response.

Running the Program
To run the program, clone this repository and navigate to the directory in your terminal. Then run the following command:

python magic_8_ball.py
Follow the prompts to ask your question. To quit the program, enter 'q' when asked for a question.

Customizing the Responses
The possible responses are stored in a list called responses. You can add or remove responses by modifying this list. Just make sure to keep the list in quotation marks and separated by commas.

Future Improvements
Some ideas for future improvements to this program include:

Adding the ability to customize the prompt message.
Allowing the user to input their own list of responses.
Adding more advanced functionality, such as the ability to handle open-ended questions.
