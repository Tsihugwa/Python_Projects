Welcome to the Ad Blocker for Facebook repository on GitHub!

This repository contains a Python script that will block ads on the Facebook website. The script uses the urllib and BeautifulSoup libraries to fetch the website content, parse the HTML, and locate all the div elements that contain ads. It then removes these ads from the website content and prints the modified content.

To use the script, simply enter the URL of the website you want to block ads on in the 'url' variable and run the script. The modified website content will be printed to the console.

We hope you find this script useful in your quest to block ads on the internet. Happy coding!
